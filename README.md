10-18-2022 Updated Guessing Game with improved validation

Peer review by Carlos Felipe: This program works amazingly well. There is an adequate response to every input. Replayability and data validation is apparent. What I didn't like so much was that you had to go to the main menu to quit. I would have liked to quit after correctly guessing the number. This is also related to the program running the same difficulty after saying "yes" to "Play again". This is just nit picking however the program overall is muy bueno.
